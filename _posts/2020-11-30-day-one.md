Today is day one. I suppose there were days prior to today, which I may describe at a later time.

My goal is to put my background in math to use in data analysis. 

I am following along with the curriculum currently set out by UCSD for their Data Science degree.
I am studying Python and the packages Matplotlib, NumPy, and pandas. 

In the process, I am hoping to develop some web dev skills. 
I am starting with a Jekyll theme as my portfolio, and hope to learn to develop from scratch along the way.

That is all for now.
