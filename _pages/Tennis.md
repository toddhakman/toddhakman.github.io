# A first attempt at data exploration.
#### by Todd Hakman

This is my first dive into data analysis, and I wanted to begin with one of my interests, tennis.
I found the data I am using on https://github.com/serve-and-volley/atp-world-tour-tennis-data.


```python
# Bringing in a few packages that I have learned about auditing DSC 10 in Fall 2020 from UCSD. (dsc10.com)
# While they used babypandas I am going to make my first attempt at using regular pandas.
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import math
import datetime
import time

# I copied these lines from the DSC 10 typical setup, as I do not know matplotlib yet.
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
%matplotlib inline
```

The data from *serve-and-volley* came separated by decade, so I compiled them all into a single csv file for use. I pulled the column titles from their github page and added a row of column titles so that when pandas reads the csv it will get the correct column titles.


```python
tournaments = pd.read_csv('data/tournaments.csv').set_index('tourney_year_id')
tournaments
```

I initially set the index as the **tourney_year_id** as this appears to be a combination of year and unique tournament identifier. This should mean that each **tourney_year_id** is a unique value and a good option for the index, as a tournament cannot occur twice in the same year. For my own sake and the reader's, this is what each column represents:

- **tourney_order** appears to be the order in the year that the tournament took place
- **tourney_type** is the type of tournament it is, if any (e.g. Grand Slam or ATP 250)
- **tourney_name** is the name of the tournament
- **tourney_id** is a unique identifier for each tournament
- **tourney_slug** is a reference for the tournament in the url format that www.atptour.com uses
- **tourney_location** is the 'city, country' of the tournament
- **tourney_date** is the date of the tournament in yyyy.mm.dd format
- **year** is the year of the tournament
- **tourney_month** is the month of the tournament
- **tourney_day** is the day of the tournament
- **tourney_singles_draw** is the number of entrants in the singles part of the tournament, if any
- **tourney_doubles_draw** is the number of entrants in the doubles part of the tournament, if any
- **tourney_conditions** is whether the tournament was indoors or outdoors.
- **tourney_surface** is the surface the tournament was on
- **tourney_fin_commit_raw** is the total prize money in the tournament, if any, with currency symbols and commas
- **currency** is the currency for the prize money of the tournament
- **tourney_fin_commit** is a formatted prize money for the tournament, if any
- **tourney_url_suffix** is the suffix that can be appended to www.atptour.com for the tournament
- **singles_winner_name** is the name of the winner of the tournament
- **singles_winner_url** is the suffix that can be appended to www.atptour.com for the winner's profile
- **singles_winner_slug** is the name of the winner in the url format that www.atptour.com uses
- **singles_winner_player_id** is the player id of the winner in the url format that www.atptour.com uses
- **doubles_winner_1_name** is the name of the first partner winner of the tournament
- **doubles_winner_1_url** is the suffix that can be appended to www.atptour.com for the winner's profile
- **doubles_winner_1_slug** is the name of the winner in the url format that www.atptour.com uses
- **doubles_winner_1_player_id** is the player id of the winner in the url format that www.atptour.com uses
- **doubles_winner_2_name** is the name of the second partner winner of the tournament
- **doubles_winner_2_url** is the suffix that can be appended to www.atptour.com for the winner's profile
- **doubles_winner_2_slug** is the name of the winner in the url format that www.atptour.com uses
- **doubles_winner_2_player_id** is the player id of the winner in the url format that www.atptour.com uses

Lets take a look at the number of tournaments per year to get an idea of how often tournaments are held.


```python
#Group our data by year and get a count, then take a look at any column that would be representative of a count, and plot it
tournaments.groupby('year').count().get('tourney_order').plot()
```

We see a huge jump in tournaments around the mid to late 1960's. What happened around this time? Per wikipedia:

> The "Open Era" began in 1968 when Grand Slam tournaments agreed to allow professional players to compete with amateurs.[65] Before 1968, only amateurs were allowed to compete in Grand Slam tournaments and other events organized or sanctioned by the ILTF, including the Davis Cup. [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis#Open_Era)

> Before the Open era, prior to the establishment of the ATP World Tour and WTA Tour, top professional players traveled largely as a group putting on a show, similar to the circus coming to town. Grand Slams were only open to amateurs. [URL](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2691000-breaking-down-the-biggest-changes-in-tennis-that-define-the-open-era)

As we are now in the Open Era, a lot of people split the two eras up when considering stats.


```python
pre_open_era = tournaments[tournaments.get('year') < 1968]
open_era = tournaments[tournaments.get('year') >= 1968]
print('There were', pre_open_era.shape[0], 'tournaments in the pre-open era, and', open_era.shape[0], 'tournaments in the open era so far.')
```

    There were 260 tournaments in the pre-open era, and 4094 tournaments in the open era so far.
    

I wonder if there were any players who won singles tournaments in both eras? I think we can find this out by grouping each set by the **singles_winner_player_id** and then doing a merge on both Data Frames, resulting in a list of players who won in both eras. Let's see.


```python
pre_open_winners = pre_open_era.groupby('singles_winner_player_id').count()
open_winners = open_era.groupby('singles_winner_player_id').count()
both_era_winners = pre_open_winners.merge(open_winners, left_index=True, right_index=True)
both_era_winners
```

Who are these players? Some python can help us figure that out!


```python
for i in both_era_winners.index:
    print(tournaments[tournaments.get('singles_winner_player_id') == i].get('singles_winner_name').iloc[0])
```

    Mal Anderson
    Roy Emerson
    Richard Pancho Gonzales
    Rod Laver
    John Newcombe
    Alejandro Olmedo
    Tony Roche
    Ken Rosewall
    Fred Stolle
    Manuel Santana
    

Is that a lot? 10 players? Let's see if we can find out. I want to start by calculating the time between first and last tournament wins for each winner, and see what the typical period of winning looks like. I only want to include players who won at least 2 tournaments, as each of these 10 players must have won 2 as well. We may look at this average for pre-open era and open era as well to compare. We can write a function in python that takes a list of player ids, and for each one, finds the first and last win and gets the time between them.


```python
#a function that will take a ATP player id and return the days between the players first and last tournament win
def reign(player_id):
    date_format = '%Y.%m.%d'
    first = datetime.datetime.strptime(
        tournaments[tournaments.get('singles_winner_player_id') == player_id].get('tourney_date').iloc[0],
        date_format
    )
    last = datetime.datetime.strptime(
        tournaments[tournaments.get('singles_winner_player_id') == player_id].get('tourney_date').iloc[-1],
        date_format
    )
    if (last - first).days == 0.0:
        return 1
    else:
        return int((last - first).days)

winners = tournaments.groupby('singles_winner_player_id').count().index
winners
winner_reigns = np.empty(0, int)
for i in winners:
    winner_reigns = np.append(winner_reigns, reign(i))
winning_names = tournaments.groupby(['singles_winner_player_id', 'singles_winner_name']).count().reset_index().set_index('singles_winner_name').index
```


```python
both_era_winners
```

- What years were most competitive? Most individual winners compared to total tournaments that year.
- What years were most dominated? By who?
- Left handers win more?
