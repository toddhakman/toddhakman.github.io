Hi! I'm Todd! I have been living in Oregon since 2015 and grew up in southern California. 

I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from California State University, San Marcos in 2012, taking courses in statistics, linear algebra,
graph theory and combinatorics. I have also pursued further studies at local community colleges for java programming, web development,
and accounting to help develop new skills.

Today, I am working on developing myself as a data analyst and preparing myself for a career working with data. While doing so, I offer
private tutoring services for all grade school subjects, predominantly math, and for undergraduate college math.

This website should hopefully serve as a place to store thoughts about my progress and to post the projects I have completed along the way.
